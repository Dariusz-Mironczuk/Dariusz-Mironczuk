Hi, my name is Dariusz. 😀

I am 21 years old and currently studying "Computer Science in Business" at the University of Economics in Wrocław. 🤓 🏬

There, I am developing my passion for programming in Python. 🐍🐍🐍

Apart from writing code, I am interested in boxing and electronics. 🥊 ⚙️

Soon, I plan to start working as a Junior Python Developer. 😉
